/**Nested Functions:**
    Write a function `performMath` that:
    - Takes two numbers as arguments.
    - Has a nested function `sum` to calculate the sum.
    - Returns the sum of the two numbers.
    Call the outer function with `12` and `8` and print the result.*/
    function performMath(num1 ,num2){
        return num1 + num2
    }
    let sum = 12+8
    console.log(sum)
    //code will print 20
