/**Assignment Operators:**
   Write code to:
   - Declare a variable `value = 10`.
   - Use `+=` and `-=` operators to add `5` and subtract `3` from `value`.  
   Print the updated value after each operation.*/
   let value = 10
   let plusEqual = value+=5
   console.log(plusEqual)
  // code will print 15
   let minusEqual = value-=3
   console.log(minusEqual)
   //the code will print 12
