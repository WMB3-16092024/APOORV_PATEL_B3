/**Math Operations:**
Write code to:
- Declare two variables `x = 10` and `y = 5`.
- Calculate their sum, product, and division.
- Print the results.*/
let x=10
let y=5
let sum = x+y
console.log(sum)
//code will print 15
let product = 10*5
console.log(product)
//code will print 50
let division = 10 / 5
console.log(division)
//code will print 2
